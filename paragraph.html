        <h1>HTML</h1>
    <P>HTML stands for hyper text markup language – it is used to display web pages on the browser. In order to create web pages, one should learn HTML.

        As its name suggests, HTML is a markup language, not a programming language. This means that we do not write programs using HTML; instead, markup language is mainly used to apply layout and formatting conventions to a text document. In other words, markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. </P>
       <h1>HTML TAG</h1>
        <p>

            The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
            The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
            The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
            The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.
